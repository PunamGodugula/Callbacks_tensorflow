# Title: Callbacks in Tensorflow:

Callbacks in TensorFlow are functions or objects that can be passed to TensorFlow's training methods to perform specific actions at various points during the training process. They provide a way to customize and extend the behavior of the training loop, allowing you to add functionality such as saving model checkpoints, early stopping, logging, and more.

Some commonly used callbacks in TensorFlow include:

1. ModelCheckpoint: This callback allows you to save the model's weights or entire model at specific intervals during training. It helps you save the best-performing model or create checkpoints for resuming training later.

2. EarlyStopping: This callback monitors a specified metric during training and stops the training early if the metric stops improving. It helps prevent overfitting and saves time by avoiding unnecessary training epochs.

3. TensorBoard: This callback allows you to visualize training metrics and monitor the model's performance using TensorFlow's TensorBoard tool. It generates log files that can be visualized in real-time or later, providing insights into the training process.

4. LearningRateScheduler: This callback enables dynamic learning rate scheduling by adjusting the learning rate at specified epochs or based on certain conditions. It helps optimize the learning process and improve model performance.

5. CSVLogger: This callback logs the training metrics, such as loss and accuracy, to a CSV file during training. It provides a convenient way to track and analyze the training progress offline.

6. LambdaCallback: This callback allows you to define custom callback functions using lambda expressions. It provides flexibility to perform custom actions at specific points during training, such as printing additional information or executing custom code.

These are just a few examples of the available callbacks in TensorFlow. You can also create your custom callbacks by subclassing the tf.keras.callbacks.Callback class and overriding its methods to define your desired behavior.

Callbacks offer a powerful mechanism to enhance and control the training process in TensorFlow. By using appropriate callbacks, you can save models, monitor metrics, adjust learning rates, and more, making your training workflow more efficient and effective.
